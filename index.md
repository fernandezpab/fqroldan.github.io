I am a PhD candidate at NYUâ€™s Department of Economics. I am on the job market and will be available for interviews at the ASSA Meetings in January 2019 as well as at the EEA Meetings in December 2018.

My research topics are in macroeconomics, international finance, sovereign debt crises, and inflation dynamics.
