Sovereign debt crises coincide with deep recessions. I propose a model of sovereign debt that rationalizes these contractions in economic activity via an aggregate-demand amplification mechanism. By explicitly separating the decisions of households and the government, I examine the interaction between sovereign risk and the precautionary savings motive. When a default looks likely, households anticipate its negative consequences and increase their savings for self-insurance reasons. This shortage in aggregate spending worsens economic conditions, boosting default incentives. I study the implications of this feedback mechanism in a model where the government of a small open economy borrows from foreign lenders but some of the debt is subsequently held by heterogeneous domestic savers subject to inunsurable idiosyncratic income risk. In a calibration to Spain in the 2000s, I find that about a third of the output contraction is caused by default risk. More generally, sovereign risk exacerbates volatility in consumption, creating large welfare costs even if default does not materialize.
