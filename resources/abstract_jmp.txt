Sovereign debt crises coincide with pronounced recessions. In the conventional view, poor economic conditions increase default incentives and bond spreads. I provide evidence suggesting that the reaction of consumption demand creates feedback from sovereign spreads to output even while the government is in good standing with creditors. Because they ignore the savings behavior of private agents, existing models cannot capture this empirical feature of crises. I study the implications of this feedback mechanism in a model where the government of a small open economy borrows from foreign lenders but some of the debt is held by heterogeneous domestic savers. Because of this heterogeneity in wealth, potential sovereign defaults carry redistributive effects besides aggregate income losses. Both effects introduce risk in private agents' expectations after bad news for repayment. Default risk then exacerbates the precautionary motive of households and depresses aggregate spending. In a calibration to Spain in the 2000s, I find that between 20% and 40% of the output contraction is attributable to default risk. More generally, sovereign risk exacerbates volatility in consumption, creating large welfare losses even if default does not materialize.
